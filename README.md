# Customer-churn-prediction
Problem StatementÂ¶
Here we have telecom company offering mobile services to there customer. They have noticed that some long time customers leaving for compititors. We need to identify

Why this problem happening ?
How we can prevent this problem ?
How much churn rate is going to happen ?
Importance of customer churn prediction
Predicting and analysing customer churn is a crucial for telecom company
It allows them to identify which customer at rick of leaving and take step to retain them
By doing so , we can reduce revenue loss, maintain customer loyalty and even gain a compatitve edge in the market

## Conclusion on XGBoost Classifier 

- **Accuracy and Cross-Validation:**

The model demonstrates a high level of accuracy, with an average score of approximately **0.9266** across five-fold cross-validation. This indicates that the model is capable of making accurate predictions on the given dataset.

- **Confusion Matrix and Classification Report:**

The confusion matrix and classification report provide a detailed breakdown of the model's performance. It exhibits a strong ability to correctly classify instances, particularly for the **False** class. 
- However, there's some room for improvement in terms of recall for the **True** class.

- Generalization and Stability:

The cross-validation scores indicate that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the dataset, suggesting good generalization and stability. This is an important characteristic for a reliable machine learning model.

- Future Improvements:

While the model's performance is strong, there is an opportunity to further enhance its precision and recall, particularly for the **True** class. - - This can be achieved through feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, or exploring more advanced machine learning algorithms.


- Robust Evaluation:

The use of cross-validation ensures that the model's performance is not overfitted to the specific dataset, making the evaluation robust and reliable.
